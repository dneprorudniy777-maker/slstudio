const faq = [

    q: "Can you really work from just the MP3?",
    a: "Yes. I use professional stem separation to split your track into vocals, drums, bass and instruments, then clean and rebuild each part. If you have Suno stems or a WAV, even better — but the MP3 is a workable starting point.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it still sound like my track?",
    a: "That's the whole point. I don't replace your song — I finish it. The melody, the voice, the vibe stay yours. What changes is the clarity, punch, loudness and the details that separate a demo from a release.",
  },
  {
    q: "Am I allowed to release Suno tracks commercially?",
    a: "If you generated the track on a paid Suno plan, Suno's terms allow commercial use. I work on the audio itself — the rights side stays between you and Suno, and it's straightforward on paid tiers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will anyone know the track was made with AI?",
    a: "Not from me. Your files go into a private store, they are never published, and I don't post before/after examples or use your track as a portfolio piece unless you specifically say I can. Whether you tell your listeners the song started in Suno is entirely your call — nothing in the finished files announces it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the finished track pass DistroKid or Spotify moderation?",
    a: "Finishing improves your odds a lot — most AI tracks that get bounced are rejected for obviously synthetic, artefact-heavy audio, and that is exactly what this work removes. But I won't pretend anyone can guarantee moderation: distributors set their own rules, those rules on AI-assisted music are still changing, and the final call is always theirs. What I can promise is that your track won't be the one rejected for sounding cheap.",
  },
  {
    q: "What loudness do you master to?",
    a: "I master for how the track actually behaves on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube after their normalization — not to a magic LUFS number. Competitive loudness without crushing the life out of the mix.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my track needs less work than I think?",
    a: "Then I'll say so. After the free preview you get an honest scope: sometimes a $39 master is genuinely all a track needs. You never pay for work your song doesn't need.",
