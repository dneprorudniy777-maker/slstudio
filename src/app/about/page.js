                    The long road to a quiet room in Warsaw
                </h2>

                    <p>
                        It started the way it usually does: a teenager, a cheap guitar,
                        and no plan B. Bands, rehearsal basements, small stages — that's
                        where I learned that music lives or dies in the details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For twenty years I played in one band. We went from tiny clubs
                        to a real fan club, airplay on radio and TV, and a proper
                        anniversary concert for our 20th year together. I know what it's
                        like to stand on a stage — and I know what a song has to go
                        through before it deserves one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All those years I was also the one behind the board: recording
                        rehearsals, mixing demos, rescuing live tapes. More than ten
                        years of it. In 2023 I turned that experience into a full-time
                        studio — SL Studio, based in Warsaw.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I mix, master, arrange and produce for independent artists
                        worldwide — from a $25 master to a full production built around
                        a voice memo. Same ears, same care, every project.

                        <p>
                            Over the decades, the musicians around me recorded hundreds
                            of songs — demos, live tapes, songs written in backyards and
                            rehearsal rooms. Much of that music survived only as worn-out
                            cassettes and low-bitrate MP3s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've restored dozens of those recordings: cleaned up the
                            noise, rebuilt arrangements, re-recorded missing parts — and
                            gave the songs back to the people who wrote them. For free.
                            Because that music deserved better than to disappear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of those musicians heard their own songs sounding better
                            than they ever had. That's still the most rewarding work
                            I've done.
