// ─── FAQ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "Can I restore a track from just the MP3?",
    a: "Yes. Stem separation works on any stereo file — WAV simply gives the algorithms more to work with, so the stems come out cleaner. If you have a paid Suno plan, always export WAV. If all you have is an MP3 of a generation you love, it's still absolutely worth doing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to replace every instrument?",
    a: "No — and that's the good news. Drums are the widest-band instrument in the mix: kick lives in the lows, snare in the mids, cymbals on top. Replace the drums alone and you mask most of the generation artifacts across the whole spectrum. Bass is the second priority. Everything else is a bonus round.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't play drums or bass?",
    a: "You don't need to. Drum replacement is triggering — a plugin detects the hits that are already in the track and fires clean samples in the same spots. Bass parts in AI tracks are usually simple enough to click into MIDI note by note, and instruments like EZbass handle the performance for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a deep restoration take?",
    a: "For someone who does this every week — a few hours per track. Your first time, budget a weekend and treat it as a course in production that costs you nothing but patience. If that's not your idea of fun, handing it to an engineer is exactly what finishing services are for.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it still my song after all the replacements?",
    a: "Yes. The composition, melody, lyrics and arrangement stay untouched — you're re-recording performances, not rewriting the song. Think of it as a cover of your own track, played better. Commercial rights for the generation itself follow your Suno plan, same as before the restoration.",
  },

              sometimes mastering can't save it. Today is the sequel — we open
              the track up, take it apart and rebuild the weak organs.

              Mastering works on the finished stereo file. It can rebalance,
              tighten, brighten and loudify — but it cannot{" "}

              . An EQ boost at 18 kHz where the generator stopped rendering
              doesn't create 'air'; it creates louder nothing.

              Last time I compared mastering a weak generation to polishing a

              Diffusion models don't record instruments — they paint one big

              Separation algorithms love filing saxophones, violins and

              every hit and fires a clean sample in exactly the same spots.
              The AI kick with its eaten transient gets replaced by a real

              Hi-hats are the biggest snitch in any AI track. Two roads here.
              If the part itself is decent, you can rebuild the missing top
              end by{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">layering white noise</strong>{" "}
              onto each hit — a detector-synth like Klevgrand Fosfat tracks
              the hats and adds a precisely shaped noise burst on top. The
              'air' that was never generated gets built from scratch:

            />
            <p>
              If the part is hopeless — snotty, smeared, rhythmically drunk —
              don't resuscitate it. Replay it in any drum sampler with
              humanized velocities. It takes ten minutes and usually sounds
              better than the original ever did.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              A quiet vinyl-noise layer over the drum bus (RC-20 style) is a
              double agent: it adds vintage character and masks the small
              leftover artifacts. Engineers were using this trick decades
              before anyone said the word 'diffusion model'.

              Solo the separated bass stem and you'll usually hear something
              like a double bass mumbling through a wall. The good news: AI
              bass lines are almost always simple. Transcribe the part into
              MIDI by ear — even clicking it in note by note takes minutes,
              not hours — and hand it to a proper bass instrument. I often
              reach for <strong className="text-white">EZbass</strong>:

            <p>
              The difference is immediate and brutal: suddenly there are{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">actual notes</strong> at 50–100
              Hz instead of a warm fog. The kick and bass finally shake hands
              instead of wrestling in the mud.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              If the new bass feels too clean for the track, don't reach for
              distortion straight away — tuck the original AI stem quietly
              underneath. Its blur becomes texture when a real instrument is
              carrying the notes.

            <SectionHeader number="6" title="Step 4: The 9 kHz Vocal Trick" />
            <p>
              You can't re-sing an AI vocal (well — you can, and it's the
              best possible upgrade, but that's a different budget). What you
              can do is separate the voice from the fizz. My go-to move:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                split the vocal at around 9 kHz
              </strong>
              . Below that line lives the actual voice — body, presence,
              consonants. Above it, in an AI vocal, lives mostly generation
              noise: shimmer, hiss, the spectral 'sniffle' that screams
              synthetic.
            </p>

              src={`${IMG}/vocal-9khz-split.jpg`}
              alt="Diagram of the 9 kHz vocal split: keep and clean everything below 9 kHz, cut the AI fizz above and replace it with clean air"
            />
            <p>
              Treat the bottom half like a normal vocal: clean it, de-ess it,
              EQ it. The top half — cut it, and rebuild the air with a gentle
              exciter or a filtered noise layer, the same philosophy as the
              hi-hats. The voice keeps its character; the plastic coating
              comes off.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              Don't slaughter everything above 9 kHz on autopilot — some
              consonants carry real energy up there. Automate the cut:
              harder on sustained notes, gentler on the S's and T's.

              After all this cleanup your track will sound strangely dry —
              the original space was baked into the generation, and we just
              scrubbed most of it off. Resist the urge to fix it with one big
              reverb; that's how you get a render again. Real productions use{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">two spaces with two jobs</strong>
              : a short ambience (small room, 0.3–0.5 s) that gives the
              elements a body, and a longer tail (plate or hall, 2–3 s) that
              gives the track depth. Both on sends, blended under the dry
              signal:
            </p>

              And then the part almost everyone skips:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">automate the sends</strong>.
              Drier verse, wider chorus, a touch of extra tail on the last
              word before the drop. Movement is what reads as 'alive' —
              static reverb is just another way of sounding generated.

              Now it's a normal mix session. Balance the new drums and bass
              against the surviving stems, glue the mix bus with a light
              compressor (1–2 dB of reduction, slow attack), and master it —
              the exact chain, LUFS targets and limiter settings are all in{" "}

              generation at matched volume. Same song — different league.
