// ─── FAQ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "Do I really need stems, or is a stereo mix enough?",
    a: "A stereo mix is enough to start - for mastering it's all I need, and for a mix assessment it's plenty. Stems simply give me more control: I can rebalance the vocal, fix the low end or replace a weak drum sound instead of working around it. Send what you have; if stems would genuinely change the result, I'll tell you before any money changes hands.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if all I have is an mp3 or a voice-memo recording from my phone?",
    a: "Send it. I say this without irony: phone demos, rehearsal-room recordings and old mp3s are a normal starting point here, not an embarrassment. I'll tell you honestly what can be achieved with it - sometimes the answer is a surprisingly good restoration, sometimes it's advice on how to re-record one part cheaply. Either way you lose nothing by asking.",
  },
  {
    q: "What WAV settings should I export?",
    a: "24-bit WAV at the sample rate your project already uses (44.1 or 48 kHz - don't convert it). Turn off any limiter or maximizer on the master bus, leave roughly 3-6 dB of headroom, and export the full length including the reverb tail at the end.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I send a Suno or other AI-generated track?",
    a: "Yes - AI-generated tracks are a normal part of my workload. Send the highest-quality export the platform gives you (WAV if available), plus the lyrics and a note about what bothers you in the sound. If the platform offers stem downloads, grab those too - they help a lot.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I send large files?",
    a: "WeTransfer (free up to 2 GB, no account needed) or a Google Drive folder link work perfectly. Zip your stems folder first so nothing gets lost, double-check the link opens in an incognito window, and send it through the contact page with a couple of lines about the song.",

                Let's get one thing out of the way first: you can send me
                anything. A voice memo from your phone, a noisy rehearsal
                recording, a ten-year-old mp3, a Suno export - all of it is a
                valid starting point, and none of it needs to be "fixed" before
                I hear it.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              So why does this guide exist? Because preparation isn't a gate -
              it's a multiplier. The same song, sent two different ways, can
              give me two very different amounts of room to work. Every minute I
              spend un-breaking a crushed export or guessing which of five files
              is the right one is a minute I'm not spending on your sound. Ten
              minutes of prep on your side regularly buys an audibly better
              result for the same money.
            </p>

              Below is everything that actually matters: formats, the one
              limiter mistake almost everyone makes, how to export stems from

            <p>
              Plenty of studios publish "submission requirements" that read like
              customs declarations, and plenty of musicians never send their
              song anywhere because of them. My rule is the opposite and it's
              the only one on this page that has no exceptions:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                the version you have right now is good enough to send.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-disc pl-5 marker:text-[#C9A84C]">
              <li>A phone recording of you and a guitar? Send it.</li>
              <li>A rehearsal-room take with the drums too loud? Send it.</li>
              <li>An old mp3 of a song you never finished? Send it.</li>
              <li>An AI-generated track that almost sounds right? Send it.</li>

            <p>
              I'll listen and tell you honestly what can be done with it and
              what it would cost - that assessment is free and doesn't obligate
              you to anything. Everything below this point is simply how to give
              me <em>more</em> to work with when you can.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              If you're hesitating between sending a rough version today and a
              "properly prepared" one someday - send the rough one today.
              Momentum finishes more songs than perfectionism ever has.

              When you do have a choice, here's the order of preference and the
              settings that matter:
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-disc pl-5 marker:text-[#C9A84C]">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">WAV (or AIFF), 24-bit.</strong>{" "}
                Lossless formats keep everything your project had. 24-bit is the
                studio standard; 16-bit is acceptable, 32-bit float is also
                perfectly fine if that's what your DAW offers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">
                  Keep the project's sample rate.
                </strong>{" "}
                If your session is 44.1 kHz, export 44.1; if it's 48, export 48.
                Converting up to 96 kHz adds nothing except file size - and
                converting down throws information away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">
                  Never convert mp3 to WAV.
                </strong>{" "}
                It doesn't restore lost quality - it just hides what the file
                really is. If an mp3 is all you have, send the mp3 itself,
                ideally the highest-bitrate original you've got.
              </li>

                Start from the very beginning and let the last chord's reverb
                tail ring out completely before the export ends. Cut-off tails
                are the most common tiny heartbreak in this job.

            <p>
              If you remember exactly one technical thing from this page, make
              it this one. Before exporting a mix for mixing or mastering,{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                switch off every limiter, maximizer and clipper on your master
                bus.
              </strong>{" "}
              A limiter squashes the peaks of your music to make it loud - and
              that squashing cannot be undone on my side. Sending a limited file
              is like mailing a letter that's already been shredded: the content
              is technically there, but nobody can work with it.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Your export will sound quieter than commercial releases. That's
              not a bug - loudness is literally what you're hiring me for.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              Quick self-check: if your exported file peaks around -6 dB and
              sounds noticeably quieter than Spotify tracks, you did everything
              right. If it's slammed against 0 dB and sounds "finished", a
              limiter is still on somewhere.

            <ProTip>
              Sanity check before sending: drag all your stems into a blank
              project, don't touch a single fader and press play. If it sounds
              exactly like your mix, the export is correct. If something is
              missing or doubled - better you find out than me, three days
              later.

              Two things matter. First: send the <em>original file</em> from the
              phone, not a messenger forward - WhatsApp and Telegram voice
              messages re-compress audio brutally, and that damage is permanent.
              Email it to yourself or upload straight to Drive. Second: don't
              "help" the recording with enhancement apps or EQ before sending -
              every automatic cleanup throws away information I could have used
              better.
