// ─── FAQ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "What LUFS should I target for a Suno track on Spotify?",
    a: "Spotify's official guidance is -14 LUFS integrated with true peak below -1 dBTP. In practice, most commercial releases sit around -7 to -9 LUFS, and I master my Suno projects to about -7…-8 LUFS with a -0.3 dB true-peak ceiling. Both approaches work — what matters is that the limiting stays clean. A loud master with baked-in distortion is worse than a quiet one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my track sound worse on Spotify than in the Suno app?",
    a: "Three things stack up: Spotify turns your track down (or up) to its normalization target, the file gets converted to a lossy format, and any true-peak overshoots turn into audible distortion during that conversion. If your master was pushed too close to 0 dB, streaming encoding is where it falls apart.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I download MP3 or WAV from Suno?",
    a: "Always WAV if your plan includes any processing. MP3 compression throws away exactly the high-frequency detail that AI tracks are already missing. WAV export requires a paid Suno plan, but if you're releasing music commercially you need a paid plan for the rights anyway.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to tell Spotify my track was made with AI?",
    a: "Distributors increasingly ask you to disclose AI-generated content, and the industry is moving toward labeling as the norm. If you generated the track on a paid Suno plan, Suno's terms allow commercial release. My advice: disclose honestly and compete on quality — a well-finished track doesn't need to hide anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a track be fixed from just the MP3?",
    a: "Yes. Modern stem separation (UVR5 with the htdemucs_ft model, or paid tools) splits a stereo file into vocals, drums, bass and instruments well enough to clean, rebalance and rebuild from. WAV gives better results, but MP3 is a workable starting point.",

            <p>
              You finished a track in Suno. In your headphones it sounded huge.
              Then you uploaded it, opened Spotify, pressed play right after
              your favorite artist… and your song walked in quiet, thin and
              somehow <em>small</em> — like it showed up to a stadium gig with
              a practice amp.

            <p>
              Spotify plays everything at a roughly equal perceived loudness.
              The default target is{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">-14 LUFS integrated</strong>:
              louder masters get turned down, quieter ones get turned up — but
              only as far as their peaks allow. There are also two listener
              settings you don't control:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">Loud</strong> (-11 LUFS, where
              Spotify applies <em>its own limiter</em> to quiet tracks — you do
              not want a robot making that decision for your mix) and{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">Quiet</strong> (-19 LUFS).
            </p>
            <ArticleImage
              src={`${IMG}/spotify-loudness-normalization.jpg`}
              alt="Loudness normalization concept: a loud waveform being turned down to a controlled level"
            />
            <p>
              Spotify also asks for{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">true peak below -1 dBTP</strong>{" "}
              (below -2 dBTP if your master is louder than -14 LUFS), because
              converting to lossy formats creates inter-sample peaks — push
              your file against 0 dB and the encoder adds crackle you never
              heard in your DAW.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's the rule that explains 90% of disappointing uploads:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                Spotify can change your volume, but it cannot un-bake your
                damage.
              </strong>{" "}
              Loudness is removable. Clipping, harsh limiting and distortion
              are printed into the file forever. A crushed track gets turned
              down to the same level as everyone else — and keeps all of its
              crunch while losing its punch.

              Credit where due: Suno's internal balance is often better than
              many bedroom mixes. But the file that comes out of the export
              button has a very recognizable set of ailments:

              These steps get a decent generation maybe 70% of the way. The
              remaining 30% — transient surgery, artifact cleanup, real
              instruments — is hand work. More on when it's worth it below.

          {/* ── 4. Loudness question ── */}
          <div id="loudness-question" className="flex flex-col gap-5">
            <SectionHeader
              number="4"
              title="The Loudness Question: -14 or -7?"
            />
            <p>
              Here's where the internet fights. The official Spotify docs say
              -14 LUFS. Meanwhile, pull any current chart hit into a meter and
              you'll find -7 to -9 LUFS. Who's right?
            </p>
            <p>
              Both, annoyingly. Spotify will turn a -8 master down to -14
              playback anyway — but <em>density survives the turn-down</em>. A
              well-made loud master played at -14 still feels more solid than a
              timid master played at -14. The catch is the phrase 'well-made':
              if you reach that loudness by slamming a limiter into a harsh,
              uncleaned AI export, you get a loud <em>and</em> ugly track that
              Spotify politely turns down to be quiet and ugly.
            </p>
            <p>
              My personal practice, take it or leave it:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                I push my masters to -7…-8 LUFS integrated
              </strong>{" "}
              — but only after the harshness is cleaned up, and always with a
              true-peak ceiling engaged. Here's an actual session, meters don't
              lie:
            </p>
            <ArticleImage
              src={`${IMG}/studioone-master-plan-annotated.jpg`}
              alt="Studio One mastering session showing -8.0 LUFS integrated, -7.1 short-term and -0.1 dB peak"
            />
            <p>
              And the limiter stage that makes it safe — the Maximizer in IRC 4
              Modern mode, output ceiling at -0.30 dB with True Peak detection
              on. The loudness gain comes <em>last</em>, after EQ cleanup,
              never instead of it:
            </p>

              src={`${IMG}/ozone12-settings-annotated.jpg`}
              alt="Ozone 12 Maximizer settings: IRC 4 Modern, output -0.30 dB, True Peak enabled"
            />
            <ProTip>
              The test that settles every loudness argument: level-match your
              master against a commercial reference and listen. If your track
              only wins when it's louder, it isn't better. And if it starts
              sounding worse as it gets louder — the answer is never 'more
              limiter'. It's cleanup.

              Honesty time. Mastering is processing on the finished stereo file
              — and some Suno problems live deeper than that. If the kick has
              no transient to enhance, if the vocal is metallic at its core, if
              the hi-hats are pure fizz — no amount of mastering will fix
              generation. That's <em>finishing</em> territory: stem separation,
              artifact cleanup per stem, replacing weak parts with real
              instruments, then mixing and mastering the rebuilt track. It's
              the difference between polishing a car and actually repairing the
              engine.
