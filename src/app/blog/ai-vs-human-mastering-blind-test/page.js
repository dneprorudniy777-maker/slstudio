// ─── FAQ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "Was this test actually fair?",
    a: "As fair as I could make it. Both masters started from the exact same mix file, both were loudness-matched to the same integrated LUFS so neither sounds 'better' just by being louder, both were exported to the same format, and the file names are anonymised. The only difference is who - or what - made the mastering decisions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where did the AI track come from?",
    a: "From Suno, one of the most popular AI music generators, exactly as it exported the song - no extra processing on my side except loudness matching. Suno delivers tracks that already sound 'mastered': loud, bright and polished on first listen. That's exactly what makes the comparison interesting.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AI mastering good enough for a Spotify release?",
    a: "Technically yes - the file will pass distribution checks and sound acceptable. Whether it competes with professionally mastered releases in the same playlist is a different question, and that's exactly what this blind test lets you judge with your own ears.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does human mastering cost compared to AI?",
    a: "AI mastering runs roughly $5-15 per track or comes bundled with subscriptions. Human mastering typically costs $50-200 per song at working-professional level; mine is $39. For a full breakdown of 2026 prices see my mixing and mastering cost guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I send you an AI-mastered track to improve?",
    a: "Better: send me the unmastered mix (or even stems) and I'll master it properly from the source. If all you have is the AI-mastered file, send that - I'll tell you honestly how much can still be recovered. The free preview applies either way.",
  },

              <strong className="text-white">
                One of the two tracks below is the song exactly as an AI music
                generator exported it - untouched. The other is the same song
                after I - a human engineer - spent a focused session with
                monitors, references and twenty years of listening. I won't tell
                you which is which. That's the whole point.

            </p>
            <p>
              You've seen the marketing from both sides. AI platforms say
              algorithms master "indistinguishably from professionals for a
              fraction of the price." Engineers say algorithms produce
              "lifeless, one-size-fits-all loudness." Both sides have something
              to sell you - including me, and I'm not going to pretend
              otherwise. So instead of arguing, let's do the only honest thing:
              a blind test where your ears are the judge.
            </p>
            <p>
              No trick questions, no rigged setup. Same song, same loudness,
              same format. Press play, vote, and then keep reading - because
              whichever way you vote, the interesting part is <em>why</em> the
              two files sound different at all.

            <p>
              A comparison like this is easy to rig and most online "AI vs
              human" demos are rigged, usually by accident. The classic mistake
              is loudness: a master that is even half a decibel louder will be
              judged "punchier" and "clearer" by almost every listener, every
              time. So here are the rules this test follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-disc pl-5 marker:text-[#C9A84C]">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Same source.</strong> Both files
                are the exact same AI-generated song. One is the generator's own
                export; the other was finished and mastered from that very file
                - nothing re-recorded, nothing swapped.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">
                  The AI plays on home turf.
                </strong>{" "}
                The AI side is a track from Suno, one of the leading AI music
                generators, exactly as it renders songs for millions of users -
                already loud, bright and finished-sounding out of the box, no
                sabotage on my part.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Loudness-matched.</strong> Both
                files were level-matched to the same integrated LUFS before
                upload, so neither one wins by simply being louder.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Anonymised.</strong> The files
                are named track-a and track-b. Which is which is defined in one
                line of code that you can't see - even the file names don't
                know.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ProTip>
              Use headphones or decent speakers if you can, and listen to each
              track at least twice before voting. Phone speakers flatten exactly
              the differences you're trying to hear - though even that is a data
              point, as we'll discuss at the end.
            </ProTip>
          </div>

            <p>
              Both clips are the same section of the same song - one is the
              untouched AI export, one is my master. Listen to both, then cast
              your vote. The reveal appears right after you choose.

              If both files sound "basically fine" to you on first listen,
              that's normal - modern AI mastering is not broken, it's generic.
              The differences live in specific places. Go back and compare these
              five things:
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-disc pl-5 marker:text-[#C9A84C]">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Low end.</strong> Does the bass
                feel controlled and readable, or just "big"? Listen to whether
                the kick keeps its punch when the bass line moves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Vocal presence.</strong> Is the
                voice forward and natural, or does clarity come with a hard,
                fatiguing edge around the consonants?

              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Dynamics.</strong> Do the quiet

              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Transitions.</strong> When the
                chorus arrives, does the track open up and lift - or does it
                just continue at the same size?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Fatigue.</strong> The sneakiest
                one: which file could you listen to three times in a row without
                wanting to turn it down?
              </li>

              Ready? Here's what separates the two files once you know what
              you're listening to. None of it is magic, and almost none of it is
              about gear. It's about decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI generator renders a song designed to impress in the first
              ten seconds: loud, bright, compressed, with a baked-in
              "radio-ready" sheen. But that sheen is applied to{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">the whole song equally</strong>.
              Transients are smeared, the low end is generic, sibilance rings
              where a human would have tamed it, and every section sits at the
              same pressure level - because nobody ever decided which part of
              the song should feel bigger than the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              The human master makes{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                section-dependent decisions
              </strong>
              : keeping the verses slightly darker and more intimate so the
              choruses physically open up, letting the kick punch through by
              managing the bass around it instead of just compressing both, and
              stopping the top end exactly at the point where "clear" would
              become "sharp" on the third listen. Each of those choices is
              invisible on a spectrum analyser and obvious to your ears over a
              full playthrough.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              This is the one-sentence summary of the whole debate: AI masters
              the <em>file</em>, a human masters the <em>song</em>. Everything
              else is detail.

            <p>
              I master for a living and I'll still say it plainly: dismissing AI
              mastering as garbage is out of date, and you should distrust any
              engineer who tells you otherwise. Here's what the algorithms
              genuinely do well in 2026:
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-disc pl-5 marker:text-[#C9A84C]">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Speed and price.</strong> Sixty
                seconds and a few dollars against days and $39-200. For some use
                cases that ratio settles the argument by itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Tonal balance.</strong> On a
                well-mixed track, AI EQ decisions are usually reasonable - it
                will fix an obviously dull or boomy mix more reliably than an
                untrained ear will.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Loudness targets.</strong> The
                output hits streaming-friendly levels consistently. You won't
                get a master that's embarrassingly quiet next to a playlist
                neighbour.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Consistency.</strong> Feed it ten
                demos and you get ten acceptable, similar-sounding results -
                genuinely useful for sketches and content.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In other words: the floor is high. What the algorithm can't raise
              is the ceiling.

              The weaknesses all grow from the same root: the algorithm has no
              idea what your song is <em>about</em>, and there is nobody on the
              other end to talk to.

                Verses, choruses and bridges get the same treatment, so the song
                loses its dynamic story - the exact thing that makes a listener
                replay it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Genre guessing.</strong> The
                profile match works until it doesn't: acoustic material gets pop
                brightness, dense rock gets scooped like EDM, and anything
                between genres confuses the model.

                Pushed to competitive loudness, algorithms tend to trade
                smoothness for edge - fine on one listen, fatiguing on three.

                <strong className="text-white">No feedback loop.</strong> You
                can't tell it "the vocal feels distant in the second chorus."
                With a human that's one revision note; with an algorithm it's a
                dead end.

                Ironically, AI masters struggle most with AI-made music - Suno
                and Udio tracks carry artifacts that a limiter amplifies instead
                of hiding. They need surgery first, not polish.

                The mix itself is rough - a $200 master can't fix a broken mix
                either, so spend nothing and fix the mix first.

              dynamics - acoustic, live, orchestral, or guitar-driven music.

              If you voted wrong - or couldn't confidently hear a difference -
              that's a real result, not a failure. It might mean your listening
              setup masks the differences, or that for your music and your
              audience, AI mastering is currently good enough. I'd rather you
              know that from a fair test than pay me out of fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              But if you heard it - the chorus that opens up, the low end that
              stays readable, the file you could replay without fatigue - then
              you know exactly what you're paying a human for. Not louder. Not
              brighter.{" "}
