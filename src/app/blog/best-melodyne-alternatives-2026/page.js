// ─── FAQ — mirrors the visible Q&A below, verbatim ───────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "Is Vovious better than Melodyne?",
    a: "For monophonic vocal editing, Vovious may feel faster and more modern. Melodyne remains stronger for polyphonic material, mature multitrack workflows, and long-term ecosystem confidence.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is RePitch a real Melodyne alternative?",
    a: "Yes. RePitch offers manual note-level pitch and timing editing and is one of the closest direct competitors. Its connection with VocAlign makes it particularly useful for layered vocals.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can MetaTune replace Melodyne?",
    a: "Not for detailed manual editing. MetaTune can replace an automatic tracking tuner such as AutoTune in many workflows, but it does not provide the same note-by-note editing environment as Melodyne.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Waves Tune Real-Time the same as Waves Tune?",
    a: "No. Waves Tune Real-Time is an automatic live and tracking tuner. Waves Tune is the graphical editor that is closer to Melodyne.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best free alternative to Melodyne?",
    a: "Start with your DAW's built-in editor. GSnap, MAutoPitch, and Graillon are useful free automatic tuners, but none fully reproduces Melodyne's manual workflow.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do professionals use Melodyne and AutoTune together?",
    a: "Yes. AutoTune or MetaTune may be used during tracking for immediate correction and vocal character. Melodyne, Vovious, or RePitch can then repair individual notes and timing after recording.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Melodyne still worth it in 2026?",
    a: "Yes, particularly for polyphonic work, multitrack editing, and studios that need a mature standard. The alternatives are compelling because they may be faster, cheaper, or more focused — not because Melodyne suddenly stopped working.",
  },

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
            <p>
              Search for a Melodyne alternative and you will find plenty of
              lists recommending MetaTune, Waves Tune Real-Time, GSnap,
              Graillon, AutoTune, and whatever else happened to be on sale when
              the article was written.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is only one problem: half of those plugins do not replace
              Melodyne.
            </p>
            <p>
              They correct pitch, yes. But Melodyne is not simply an automatic
              tuner. It is a note-level audio editor. You can open a recorded
              performance, separate notes, repair pitch drift, reshape vibrato,
              move timing, adjust formants, and decide exactly which
              imperfections should stay. A real-time tuner that pulls every note
              toward a scale may be useful, but it is solving a different
              problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent time going through product documentation, engineer
              discussions, Reddit threads, and user reports because I wanted to
              separate genuine Melodyne competitors from plugins that merely
              share the words &ldquo;pitch correction&rdquo; on the box.
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer is not a dramatic &ldquo;Melodyne is dead&rdquo;
              headline. Melodyne is still exceptionally capable, especially for
              polyphonic material and established professional workflows. But it
              is no longer the only serious option — and depending on the job,
              it may not be the fastest or most comfortable one.

              The distinction matters because an automatic tuner can make the
              entire vocal &ldquo;more correct&rdquo; while still placing one
              phrase on the wrong note. A manual editor lets you repair that
              phrase without ironing the personality out of everything around
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many engineers use both categories. Track through an automatic
              tuner, then open the final vocal in a note editor. It sounds
              excessive until the automatic plugin confidently corrects one
              expressive slide to the wrong scale degree. Then the second stage
              suddenly feels less like luxury and more like insurance.

              Small pitch changes rarely expose major differences. Most
              competent tools can move a clean note by ten cents without setting
              the room on fire. The real test is messy material: slides, breathy
              attacks, fast phrases, note transitions, vibrato, doubles, and
              vocals recorded by a human being rather than a calibration tone.

                Why it stands out
              </h3>
              <p>
                Vovious makes problem notes easy to find. Its color system shows
                pitch confidence and deviation clearly, instead of presenting
                the entire performance as a neutral field of blobs and asking
                you to investigate each one like a detective with a deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also includes several workflow details that sound minor until
                you tune vocals every week:

                  "separate amplitude control for unvoiced sounds;",
                  "temporary-note editing for small sections;",
                  "ARA2 integration;",

              />
              <p>
                The main appeal is speed. The interface encourages you to fix
                what needs fixing and leave the rest alone. That is exactly how
                natural vocal tuning should work.

              <p>
                Forum discussions repeatedly mention the modern interface,
                smooth processing, and more enjoyable workflow. Some users
                describe difficult glides and strong pitch moves as sounding
                cleaner than equivalent edits in Melodyne. Others prefer Vovious
                even in DAWs without full ARA convenience because the editing
                logic feels more direct.
              </p>
              <p>That enthusiasm is worth noting, but so are the caveats.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                Vovious is still young. User reports include requests for better
                original-versus-corrected comparison, more granular reset and
                undo behavior, and occasional stability concerns in early
                versions. The development team has already issued multiple
                compatibility and bug-fix updates, which is encouraging, but it
                does not magically give the plugin Melodyne&rsquo;s two-decade
                track record.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also <strong className="text-white">monophonic</strong>.
                Melodyne&rsquo;s higher editions can edit notes inside
                polyphonic piano or guitar material. Vovious is designed for
                vocals and other single-note sources.

                Price comparison needs context
              </h3>
              <p>
                It is tempting to write &ldquo;Vovious costs $229, Melodyne
                Studio costs $699&rdquo; and declare a knockout. That comparison
                is catchy and incomplete.
              </p>
              <p>
                For straightforward monophonic vocal work, Melodyne Assistant is
                the more relevant comparison than Melodyne Studio. Studio earns
                its higher price through multitrack and polyphonic capabilities
                that Vovious does not try to replace.
              </p>
            </div>

            <Verdict>
              choose Vovious if your work is mainly vocals and you value speed,
              clarity, and a modern interface more than polyphonic editing or
              decades of ecosystem history.

              It is a genuine note editor. You can adjust pitch, timing, note
              length, formants, transitions, and detailed pitch curves. Macros
              get you close quickly, then manual tools let you deal with the
              phrases that refuse to behave.

                The real advantage: RePitch does not live alone
              </h3>
              <p>
                RePitch becomes especially interesting when paired with
                VocAlign. Through SynchroLink, edited lead-vocal information can
                feed the alignment workflow for doubles and backing vocals.
              </p>
              <p>
                That solves a common production problem. Tuning one lead is
                manageable. Tuning the lead, two doubles, eight harmonies, and a
                stack of ad-libs makes you reconsider every decision that
                brought you into music.
              </p>
              <p>
                A connected pitch-and-alignment workflow can save far more time
                than a slightly prettier note display.

              <p>
                Engineers often praise RePitch for natural results, flexible
                note splitting, and the ability to draw or reshape pitch
                behavior more directly than in Melodyne. Timing controls sit
                close to pitch controls, which reflects how vocal editing
                actually works: a note that feels wrong may be late rather than
                flat.
              </p>
              <p>
                RePitch 2 also offers a sensible edition structure. Standard is

                Not everyone finds the interface immediately comfortable. Some
                longtime Melodyne users describe it as clunky until the workflow
                clicks. There are also community concerns around subscription
                direction and how existing Synchro Arts customers were handled
                after the LANDR acquisition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those are not sound-quality problems, but purchasing a plugin
                means buying into its update and licensing ecosystem too. The
                audio may be timeless. Account managers rarely are.

              choose RePitch 2 if you work with lead vocals, doubles, and

                established dedicated editing environment. If you never need the
                real-time AutoTune sound, you may be paying for half a product
                you do not use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The price is also substantially higher than RePitch Standard or
                many sale-priced alternatives.

            </div>

            <Verdict>
              choose AutoTune Pro 11 if automatic tuning and manual editing are
              equally important and you want both under one roof.

              Waves Tune Real-Time is an automatic tracking tuner. Waves Tune is

              often heavily discounted, which makes it one of the cheapest ways

              <p>
                The workflow feels old. Tempo changes and transfer behavior have
                caused frustration for some users, and the Waves
                licensing/update ecosystem remains divisive. Several DAWs now
                include built-in tools that cover the same basic territory
                without another installer, license manager, or annual
                conversation about upgrade plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, when Waves Tune is on sale and your DAW lacks a capable
                editor, it can solve the job for very little money.
              </p>
            </div>

            <Verdict>
              choose Waves Tune when budget matters more than modern workflow
              and you need manual note editing rather than live correction.

                Flex Pitch lives directly in Logic&rsquo;s audio editor. It
                handles pitch center, drift, vibrato, timing, formants, and gain

                Users generally see Melodyne as more refined for difficult
                corrections, but Flex Pitch is fast, integrated, and completely
                adequate for many pop and demo vocals.

                Users often describe it as easier to perform through than more

                It tends to be less aggressively robotic than some competitors

                support without turning pitch correction into the main
                character.

              This two-stage approach sounds slower. In practice it is faster

              cannot understand.

              The best overall Melodyne alternative for vocal-only work is{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">Vovious</strong>. It offers the
              clearest modern workflow and is designed around the exact
              frustration many engineers have with Melodyne: tuning takes too
              long and too much clicking.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best production-system alternative is{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">RePitch 2</strong>, especially when
              doubles and harmonies need timing alignment as well as pitch
              correction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best hybrid is{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">AutoTune Pro 11</strong>, because
              it can follow the vocal from tracking through Graph Mode editing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best budget manual editor is{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">Waves Tune</strong>, while the best
              free option is usually the editor already included in your DAW.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the most honest conclusion is this: there is no universal
              replacement for Melodyne because users are trying to replace
              different parts of it. Choose the workflow first. The plugin
              becomes much easier to choose once you stop asking every pitch
              tool to do the same job.
