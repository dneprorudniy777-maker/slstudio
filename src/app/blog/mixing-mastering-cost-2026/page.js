// ─── FAQ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
  {
    q: "Is $100 enough for a professional mix and master in 2026?",
    a: "In a commercial studio in LA or London - no, $100 barely covers an hour of room time. Online, working directly with an engineer who has no rent and no staff - yes, absolutely. The honest test is not the price tag but the before/after examples in your genre. If the engineer can show a raw session turned into a release-ready track, the number on the invoice matters far less than people think.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do prices range from $5 to $5,000 for the same service?",
    a: "Because you are paying for three different things at once: the engineer's ears and experience, their overhead (commercial room, staff, gear amortization), and their name. The sound quality curve flattens quickly - a $500 mix is rarely five times better than a $100 mix. Above the working-professional tier you are increasingly paying for credits, priority and brand, not for extra decibels of quality.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need separate engineers for mixing and mastering?",
    a: "The classic argument for a separate mastering engineer is fresh ears and a second room. It still holds for big-budget releases. For independent singles in 2026, a good engineer who mixes AND masters your track - while checking it against commercial references - delivers a result the listener cannot tell apart. What actually matters is that mastering is not skipped entirely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AI mastering (LANDR, eMastered) good enough?",
    a: "For demos, drafts and frequent low-stakes uploads - yes, $5-40 per track is unbeatable value. For a release you promote, AI hits its ceiling: it cannot fix a mix problem, it cannot make taste decisions, and it tends to over-brighten and over-compress. Typical workflow in 2026: AI for work-in-progress checks, a human engineer for the version that goes on your artist profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I budget for a whole album?",
    a: "Mid-tier US/UK engineers quote roughly $1,500-$3,500 for a 10-12 track album (mix + master). Online professionals with lower overhead do the same scope for $900-$1,500, often with a bulk discount. A practical strategy: spend more on your lead single, use the standard rate for the rest, and always ask for an album price - almost everyone has one.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many revisions should be included in the price?",
    a: "Two to three included revision rounds is the industry standard in 2026. 'Unlimited revisions' sounds generous but usually signals either a beginner building a portfolio or a factory that counts on you giving up after round two. More important than the number: the revision policy should be written down before you pay.",

                In 2026, mixing and mastering a single song costs anywhere
                from $5 with AI tools to $5,000+ at a top-tier studio. For
                most independent artists the realistic range is $100&ndash;$350
                per track for a professional online mix and master; mid-tier
                engineers with major-label credits charge $475&ndash;$1,000.

            <p>
              That's the direct answer. The interesting part is <em>why</em>{" "}
              one engineer quotes $75 and another quotes $750 for what looks
              like the same job - and how to tell which one your release
              actually needs. I mix and master for a living, my own prices are
              public, and I have nothing to hide: let's take the whole market
              apart, tier by tier.

              your liner notes. The sound quality curve flattens out much

                problems in 30 seconds that a beginner won't find in a week.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Session complexity.</strong>{" "}
                12 clean stems is one job; 60 tracks with bleed, timing issues
                and untuned vocals is a very different one. Most engineers
                price by stem count for exactly this reason.

                <strong className="text-white">Revisions.</strong> Included
                rounds cost the engineer real hours, so "2 revisions included"
                vs "unlimited" changes the honest price.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Deliverables.</strong> A WAV
                master is standard. Stems, instrumentals, a cappellas, Dolby
                Atmos versions - each adds work and shows up in the quote.

              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Overhead and brand.</strong>{" "}
                Commercial room rent, staff, a famous name. This is the part
                of the price that does NOT reach your ears - and the part
                online engineers cut out.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ProTip>
              When comparing quotes, mentally subtract the overhead. Ask:
              which part of this price is ears, and which part is real estate?
              A $600 mix from a commercial studio and a $150 mix from the same
              quality engineer working from a treated home room can be the
              same product.

              Grammy-credited names. At this level you buy priority, brand and
              politics as much as sound. Even engineers inside this tier admit
              publicly that a caring mid-tier pro often delivers the same
              sonic result.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              Judge every tier the same way: ask for a before/after in your
              genre. A raw-stems-to-final comparison tells you more in two
              minutes than any price tag, credit list or review page.

              Mastering is cheaper than mixing because it's one stereo file,
              not sixty tracks - but the tier logic is identical:

            <p>
              About AI: LANDR charges $10 for a single track master and
              subscriptions start around the price of one human master per
              month. For work-in-progress checks that's genuinely useful. The
              ceiling is just as real: an algorithm can't fix a muddy mix,
              can't decide the chorus should hit harder than the verse, and
              still tends to over-brighten and over-compress. If the track
              matters, a human touches it -{" "}

            <p>
              Published 2026 guides aimed at US indie artists suggest
              budgeting $300&ndash;$700 per single (mix + master combined),
              $1,200&ndash;$2,500 for a 4&ndash;6 track EP and
              $1,500&ndash;$3,500 for a full album at the credited mid-tier
              level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those numbers are honest - for that tier. Working with an online
              professional, the same scope typically lands at{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">
                $100&ndash;$350 per single, $400&ndash;$900 per EP and

              </strong>
              , usually with a bulk discount baked in.
            </p>
            <ProTip>
              Don't split the budget evenly. Put the most money and revision
              time into your lead single - the track that runs in ads and
              playlists - and use the standard rate for the rest. Nobody
              streams track 9 first.

              How is that possible without cutting corners? The boring math of
              overhead. I work online from a treated studio in Warsaw: no
              commercial rent in a Western capital, no staff, no receptionist
              baked into your invoice. You work directly with the engineer who
              actually opens your session. Industry guides point out the same
              arbitrage: comparable quality costs 20&ndash;40% less outside
              major Western cities. That discount is real - it just isn't a
              discount on the ears.

              And because trust is the honest bottleneck at every tier, I
