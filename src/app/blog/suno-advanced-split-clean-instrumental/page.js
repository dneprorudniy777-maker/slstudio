const faqItems = [
    {
        q: "Can Suno remove vocals completely?",
        a: "It can produce a much cleaner instrumental, especially when Advanced Split is combined with manual reconstruction. It cannot guarantee that every regenerated instrument will match the original arrangement perfectly.",
    },
    {
        q: "Which mode should I use for a backing track?",
        a: "Use Split from Mix for a quick rehearsal or performance version. Use Advanced Split and a DAW when you need control over individual instruments, recording your own vocal, or preparing a more polished production.",
    },
    {
        q: "Why does the instrumental still have holes after vocal removal?",
        a: "Vocals overlap with other instruments in both frequency and ambience. A traditional separator may remove shared musical information along with the voice. Advanced Split attempts to avoid that by rebuilding the surrounding parts.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do I need a paid Suno plan?",
        a: "Yes. Auto Split and Split from Mix are available on paid plans. Advanced Split is available to Premier subscribers.",
    },
    {
        q: "Should I choose Fixed tempo or Follow tempo changes?",
        a: "Choose Fixed tempo when you want a steady grid for editing, replacing drums, or adding MIDI instruments. Choose Follow tempo changes when preserving the source performance's timing movement is more important.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can mastering remove stem artifacts?",
        a: "Mastering can reduce harshness, control dynamics, and make the mix more cohesive. It cannot reconstruct missing notes or remove heavy bleed. A badly damaged stem may need to be regenerated, replaced, or replayed.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can I use the same method to isolate vocals?",
        a: "Yes. Advanced Split can regenerate a vocal stem as well. The result may still need manual cleanup in dense sections or where the original contains long reverb tails.",
    },

                        <p>If you have ever tried to turn a finished song into a clean instrumental, you probably know the moment when everything goes slightly wrong. The full mix sounds convincing. Then you remove the vocal, and the backing track suddenly develops dents: guitars fade in and out, cymbals turn watery, the midrange collapses, and a faint ghost of the singer hangs around like someone who has not realized the party is over.</p>
                        <p>This is not uniquely a Suno problem. It is what happens when any separator tries to pull apart audio that has already been mixed. Vocals, guitars, keys, drums, and reverb all overlap. Separating them perfectly is a bit like removing raisins from a baked cake and expecting the sponge to look untouched afterward.</p>
                        <p>In June 2026, Suno updated its stem-separation tools and introduced <strong className="text-white">Advanced Split</strong>. The important difference is that the selected part can be regenerated from the performance the model hears, rather than only carved out of the finished mix.</p>
                        <p>I tested the new workflow with one practical goal: building a usable instrumental without an obvious vocal-shaped hole in the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The short version: there is still no magic button. There is, however, a workflow that gets much closer.</p>

                        <p>A finished song is not a folder containing neat files called <Mono>vocal.wav</Mono>, <Mono>guitar.wav</Mono>, and <Mono>drums.wav</Mono>. It is one combined signal.</p>
                        <p>Lead vocals usually occupy the midrange, which is also where guitars, keyboards, snare detail, and many synths live. The vocal reverb and delay are blended into the same space as the rest of the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>A conventional separator analyzes that signal and estimates which parts belong to which source. If it removes too little, fragments of words and breaths remain in the instrumental. If it removes too much, pieces of the guitar, keys, and cymbals disappear with the voice.</p>
                        <p>That is where the familiar problems come from:</p>
                        <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5">
                            {[

                                <>a stem mix that sounds flatter than the original song.</>,
                            ].map((item, i) => (
                                <li key={i} className="flex gap-3 items-baseline">

                        </ul>
                        <p>The reverse is equally true. If you need an isolated vocal, the result may contain hi-hats, bass resonance, guitar attacks, and reverb from the full mix. Same technical problem, different side of the glass.</p>

                            <p>Auto Split is the quickest way to find out what Suno thinks is in the arrangement. It can create up to 12 stems for categories such as vocals, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, and woodwinds.</p>
                            <p>I use it as reconnaissance. It tells me which parts the system detects and which existing stems may already be usable. The labels are not always perfect: a breathy synth may become a flute, and a flute may become something that sounds as if it needs its own passport.</p>
                            <p>Auto Split costs 50 credits for the full set.</p>

                                {["the selected source;", "the rest of the mix without it."].map((item, i) => (

                            <p>For a quick rehearsal instrumental, that may be enough. The limitation is that the &ldquo;everything else&rdquo; file is still a combined mix. If one instrument collapses around the removed vocal, you cannot repair that instrument independently.</p>
                            <p>A selected extraction uses 10 credits, and the complementary stem uses another 10, for 20 credits in total.</p>

                            <p>Advanced Split is available on Suno Premier. It lets you choose from almost 100 possible sources, ranging from a full drum kit and electric bass to specific strings, winds, and less common instruments.</p>

                        <p>The major difference is that the requested stem can be <strong className="text-white">regenerated from scratch based on the detected performance</strong>. It is not simply a frequency-shaped slice of the existing mix. That is why it can avoid some of the holes left by conventional vocal removal.</p>
                        <p>The word <em>regenerated</em> matters. The new stem is not guaranteed to be a sample-perfect copy. Suno may alter the tone, attack, rhythmic detail, or interpretation. It can also mistake a neighboring sound for part of the requested instrument.</p>
                        <p>In other words, Advanced Split can give you cleaner isolation, but it does not give you laboratory evidence.</p>
                        <p>There is another practical catch: requesting an instrument that is not present may still consume credits, even if the result is unusable. Run Auto Split first, listen carefully, and only then start ordering individual parts.</p>

                            <p>I begin with Auto Split and audition every result. At this stage I am asking two questions:</p>
                            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5">
                                {[

                                    <li key={i} className="flex gap-3 items-baseline">
                                        <span className="flex-shrink-0" style={{ color: "rgba(201,168,76,0.6)" }}>•</span>

                            </ul>
                            <p>One of the most useful pieces of advice from community stem guides is not to search for the mythical &ldquo;best separator.&rdquo; Instead, choose the particular result that preserves the most important part of that particular song.</p>
                            <p>If the song is driven by the vocal, judge the vocal stem first. If the hook is a bass riff, protect the bass. If the entire track depends on one guitar texture, that guitar is the priority.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes several Auto Split stems are already good enough. There is no prize for regenerating a part that does not need fixing.</p>

                            <p>For a serious instrumental, I do not rely on a single &ldquo;everything except vocals&rdquo; file. I request the main elements separately:</p>
                            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5">
                                {[

                                    "strings or winds, if they are clearly present.",
                                ].map((item, i) => (
                                    <li key={i} className="flex gap-3 items-baseline">
                                        <span className="flex-shrink-0" style={{ color: "rgba(201,168,76,0.6)" }}>•</span>

                            <p>This gives me control over the reconstruction. If the piano is weak, I can regenerate, replace, or lower the piano without rebuilding the entire backing track.</p>
                            <p>I would not base the whole workflow on isolated kick, snare, and cymbal extractions yet. Sometimes they work. Other times, three different requests produce three slightly different versions of the same complete beat. A full drum-kit stem is usually the safer starting point.</p>

                            <p>Generated music can contain tempo drift — small changes in timing similar to a live performance. That can sound natural in the full song, but it becomes awkward when you move stems onto a rigid DAW grid.</p>
                            <p>In the current download dialog, choose <strong className="text-white">WAV</strong> and select <strong className="text-white">Fixed tempo</strong> when you want a steady average BPM for simpler editing.</p>

                            <p>Fixed tempo is not automatically &ldquo;better.&rdquo; It is a workflow choice. If the original performance depends on intentional pushes and pulls, Follow tempo changes may preserve the feel more faithfully. For rebuilding a backing track, adding programmed drums, or replacing instruments, Fixed tempo is usually easier.</p>
                            <p>Use WAV rather than MP3. Compression artifacts may be fairly quiet in the full mix, but EQ, saturation, and repeated exports have a habit of introducing them to everyone in the room.</p>

                            <p>Low-pass the sub-focused copy. On the midrange copy, remove unnecessary sub energy and gradually cut the highest artifact-heavy frequencies. If the bass loses definition, a little saturation can rebuild audible harmonics.</p>
                            <p>Use drum sidechain carefully. Suno bass often already contains rhythmic movement from the original generation. Heavy sidechain on top of that can turn the bass into a nervous air pump.</p>

                        <p>The most consistent results came from bass, full drum-kit stems, relatively simple synth parts, and instruments with a clear timbre and an obvious role in the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The more difficult cases were piano and guitar occupying the same register, long dense reverb, several similar synth layers, individual drum components, and choruses where everything plays at once — including what may or may not be an imaginary food processor.</p>
                        <p>Instrument recognition also misses occasionally. A requested flute may return as a breathy synth. That is not always a simple labeling error: the generated sound may genuinely sit somewhere between the two, and the model has to pick a side.</p>

                        <p>Before Advanced Split, many users recommended downloading the full WAV and processing it with tools such as <strong className="text-white">Ultimate Vocal Remover 5</strong>, <strong className="text-white">Demucs</strong>, <strong className="text-white">MVSep</strong>, <strong className="text-white">BS Roformer</strong>, <strong className="text-white">MelBand Roformer</strong>, Moises, and Kits AI.</p>
                        <p>Those tools are still useful. One separator may win on vocals, another on drums, and a third on one very specific song for reasons known only to the machines.</p>
                        <p>The practical difference is:</p>
                        <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2.5">

                        <p>A hybrid approach is often best. You might use a Roformer vocal, an Advanced Split bass, sampled drums, and an Auto Split guitar. That is not cheating. That is production.</p>

                        <p>If the source track feels flat, try creating a remastered version before extracting stems. A different render may improve depth and make individual parts easier to identify.</p>
                        <p>Do not automatically replace the original. Remastering can change tone, balance, and arrangement details. Make a few versions and compare them at matched loudness. If one version is merely louder, it has not necessarily become wiser.</p>
