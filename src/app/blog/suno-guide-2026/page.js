// ─── FAQ: instrumental / no vocals ───────────────────────────────────────────
const faqItems = [
    {
        q: "How do I force Suno to make an instrumental track — no vocals at all?",
        a: "Use all three levers at once: switch on the Instrumental toggle in Custom Mode, add the word “instrumental” to your style description (for example: “jazz rock fusion, smooth and sophisticated, instrumental”), and leave the lyrics field empty. If you want to control the arrangement, fill the lyrics field only with bracketed structure tags like [Intro], [Instrumental], [Guitar Solo], [Outro] — brackets are commands, not lyrics.",
    },
    {
        q: "Why does Suno still add vocals when my prompt says “instrumental”?",
        a: "Almost always because there is text outside square brackets. Suno treats anything outside brackets as lyrics to be performed out loud — even the words “no vocals”. Remove all unbracketed text from the lyrics field, keep “instrumental” in the style description, and the vocals disappear.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do I make longer instrumental tracks in Suno?",
        a: "Generate a strong base first, then use Extend to grow the track section by section instead of hoping for one long generation. Inside the lyrics field, chain instrumental structure tags — [Intro], [Instrumental], [Guitar Solo], [Outro] — so every extended section stays vocal-free.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do I get spoken word or narration instead of singing?",
        a: "Describe the vocal delivery explicitly in the style prompt — “spoken word, narration, no singing”. If you leave the vocal undescribed, Suno decides for you. Reinforce it with bracketed production notes like [spoken word] placed before the lines you want narrated.",

                        <p>If your current workflow is: open Suno → type something → hit Generate → hope for the best — you are not using this tool. You are playing a slot machine with audio.

                        <p>Here is what nobody tells you when you first open Suno: it looks complicated, but it is just a workspace. The same way a DAW looked terrifying on day one — all those tracks, buttons, meters you did not understand — Suno operates by exactly the same logic.</p>
                        <p><strong className="text-white">It is a digital environment. You are in control.</strong> It just does not feel that way at first, because the interface is new and the results are unpredictable until you understand the rules.</p>
                        <p>The biggest beginner mistake is trying to skip the learning curve entirely. Massive prompt on day one, maximum settings cranked up, expecting a release-ready track. That is like sitting at a grand piano for the first time and immediately attempting Rachmaninoff. You will get noise. Impressive-looking noise, but noise.</p>
                        <p>What makes Suno powerful is the same thing that makes any professional tool powerful: understanding how it thinks, what it responds to, and where its limitations actually are. Once you have that, the tool stops fighting you and starts working with you.</p>

                        <p>Use Simple Mode first. Most great tracks begin there. The exploration phase is not wasted time — it is where you figure out what you actually want. Skipping it does not save time, it just moves the confusion to a more complicated interface.</p>
                        <ProTip>Spend your first 5–10 generations in Simple Mode for every new project. Once one of them feels right — that is when you open Custom Mode. Not before.</ProTip>

Suno does not know what you care about most, so it starts guessing. And when AI guesses, you get something technically impressive that sounds like nobody's music in particular.</p>

                        <p>The underlying logic here is important: every song is built from <strong className="text-white">repeating and contrasting sections</strong>. Verses build the story, choruses deliver the emotional payload, bridges shift the perspective, and instrumental sections control the energy flow. When you understand this, you stop thinking of a song as "a bunch of parts" and start thinking of it as a designed emotional experience.</p>

                        <p>Listeners do not care how a track was made. They only care how it sounds. A Suno-generated track with professional <a href="/mixing-mastering" style={{ color: "#C9A84C", textDecoration: "underline" }}>mixing and mastering</a> sounds better than a traditionally recorded track that was never properly mixed. The tools do not matter. The result does.</p>
                        <p>Suno is a spectacular starting point. It is not the finish line. The next step after Suno is stems, balance, vocal treatment, arrangement detail — all the things that separate a demo from something that actually hits the way you intended.</p>

For non-singers, it is a chance to hear your own voice in music for the first time, which is a genuinely surprising experience.</p>

                                <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">Suno trains the voice model on whatever audio you give it. If your recording has air conditioning hum, room reverb, background music, or street noise — all of that gets baked into the model. The result: when the model generates your voice in a track, it carries those artifacts with it. The vocal sounds muddy, unstable, or artificially processed in ways you cannot fix after the fact.</p>
                                <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-1">This is not a post-processing problem — it is a training data problem. No algorithm can remove noise that is already part of the model. The only fix is a clean source recording.</p>
                                <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-1">Optimal conditions: a quiet room, a decent microphone or quality headset, close mic placement. Recording early in the morning or late at night when street noise is minimal is not overthinking it — it actually makes a difference. One good voice recording made once is an investment. A noisy recording is a limitation you carry into every track you make with it.</p>

                            <p>Upload your own tracks made outside Suno and the model learns your style. After training, it generates music that sounds more like you — your genre preferences, your characteristic instrument choices, your sonic aesthetic — rather than a generic AI average.</p>
                            <p>The logic is similar to DAW presets and templates, except instead of saving plugin settings you are curating a training set. The model picks up surface-level characteristics — timbre, genre markers, instrumental texture — reliably. Deeper compositional tendencies like arrangement restraint, timing, and dynamic contrast are harder to encode. The more distinctive your style, the more interesting the result.</p>

                            <p>Free for all users. Suno tracks what you generate, which genres and moods you choose, what you like and what you skip — and gradually builds a preference profile. When you hit the magic wand during generation, My Taste applies that accumulated context and nudges results toward what you typically enjoy, without any explicit instructions in the prompt.</p>
                            <p>It works better the more consistently you use Suno — and the more honest you are in your Library filtering. Like blues rock and dislike pop → My Taste notices. Like everything indiscriminately → the system cannot figure out what you actually want and helps less. Filter your Library honestly. It feeds directly into this.</p>

                            <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">Working with Suno is a skill. Not a prompt hack, not a secret formula — a skill. The kind that develops through regular practice, honest listening, and a willingness to understand the tool rather than fight with it.</p>
                            <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">The musicians who get the most out of Suno are not the ones who found the magic prompt. They are the ones who understood the logic, built a workflow, and kept showing up. They treat it like a collaborator rather than a vending machine.</p>
                            <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">Suno accelerates your learning curve. It does not replace the work. The work is still yours — and that is a good thing. Because the work is also where the music actually lives.</p>
                            <p className="text-white font-semibold mt-2 text-lg">Now go make something.</p>
