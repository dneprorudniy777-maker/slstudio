        q: "How long does it take to master one song?",
        a: "One to three hours of actual work for a single track. The full turnaround — from sending files to receiving the final master — is typically 3–5 business days, which includes quality control, ear rest between sessions, and your review time.",
    },
    {
        q: "Why does mastering take 3–5 days if the work itself takes a few hours?",
        a: "Because the timeline includes more than processing: scheduling, focused listening sessions with breaks (fresh ears catch more problems), quality control on multiple playback systems, your own review period, and a revision round if needed.",
    },
    {
        q: "How long does it take to mix a song?",
        a: "Mixing is a separate stage and usually takes longer than mastering — from several hours to a few days per song, depending on the track count and the state of the recordings. A clean, well-mixed track is also the single biggest factor in fast mastering.",
    },
    {
        q: "How long do mastering revisions take?",
        a: "Revision adjustments are usually completed within 24 hours of your feedback. Most projects finalise after the first revision round.",
    },
    {
        q: "How long does it take to mix and master a whole album?",
        a: "For a typical 8–12 track album, plan on two to four weeks of calendar time. Each song still needs its own focused mixing and mastering pass, but an album adds work a single doesn't: an album-wide consistency pass so tone, loudness and character match across every track, plus checks on the transitions between songs. Rushing an album is exactly where that cohesion gets lost.",
    },
    {
        q: "How long does it take to mix an album versus a single song?",
        a: "A single song is several hours to a couple of days of mixing. An album is not simply that multiplied: after the individual mixes there's an album-wide pass to match balance, tone and level across all the tracks so the record sounds like one body of work rather than a dozen unrelated singles. For 10 songs, plan on two to three weeks of mixing before mastering begins.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can a full album be mastered faster if all the mixes are ready?",
        a: "Yes — clean, consistent mixes are the single biggest time-saver. If every track is well balanced and delivered with headroom, album mastering moves quickly and the consistency pass is mostly fine-tuning. If the mixes vary in quality or loudness, each one has to be corrected first, which is what stretches an album timeline.",

                        Every artist wants to know this before they send their files. The honest answer is: it depends — but here is exactly what it depends on, and what a realistic timeline looks like.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <p>Professional <a href="/mixing-mastering" style={{color: "#C9A84C", textDecoration: "underline"}}>mastering</a> typically takes one to three hours of focused work per song. The total timeline from sending files to receiving the finished master is usually three to five business days. This might seem longer than expected, but there are specific reasons why rushing the process almost always compromises the result.</p>
                        <p>This breakdown covers what actually happens during those hours, what factors affect the timeline, and how to get the fastest possible result without sacrificing quality.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
                        <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white">What Happens During the Mastering Session</h2>
                        <p>The process starts with careful listening — not passive background listening, but active analysis. Frequency balance, dynamic range, stereo image, how the track translates from studio monitors to earbuds. This initial assessment takes fifteen to twenty minutes and sets the direction for everything that follows.</p>
                        <p>The technical processing phase is where the actual work happens. EQ decisions to balance frequencies, compression to control dynamics while preserving musical feel, stereo enhancement, and limiting to achieve competitive loudness. Each of these requires judgment calls that depend on the specific track — there is no template that works equally well on a blues recording and a dense electronic production.</p>
                        <p>After processing comes quality control — checking the master on multiple playback systems. Studio monitors at different volumes, consumer headphones, phone speakers. This phase catches problems that sound fine in one context but fall apart in another. It takes time, but it is what separates a professional master from a quick automated result.</p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white">The Biggest Factor: Your Mix</h2>
                        <p>The single most important variable in mastering time is the quality of the mix that arrives. A well-balanced mix where frequencies are properly managed, dynamics are controlled, and the gain staging is clean — mastering that track is focused on enhancement and final polish. One hour of work, clean result.</p>
                        <p>A mix with fundamental problems — frequency buildups causing muddiness, excessive compression crushing dynamics, harsh resonances, phase issues — requires significantly more time. The mastering engineer has to address problems that should have been handled during mixing before they can even begin the actual mastering work.</p>
                        <p>This is why investing in quality <a href="/mixing-mastering" style={{color: "#C9A84C", textDecoration: "underline"}}>mixing</a> before mastering consistently produces better results faster. A properly mixed track gets mastered efficiently. A problematic mix gets corrected first — which takes time and limits what mastering can ultimately achieve.</p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white">How Genre Affects the Timeline</h2>
                        <p>Simple acoustic tracks and straightforward arrangements require less complex processing and can often be completed closer to the one-hour mark. The frequency relationships are more manageable and the dynamic range is more predictable.</p>
                        <p>Dense productions — heavy metal with complex frequency relationships, electronic music with multiple competing layers, hip-hop with intricate low-end work, orchestral recordings with wide dynamic ranges — demand more time. The decisions are more consequential and the margin for error is smaller.</p>
                        <p>Blues rock and live band recordings tend to fall in the middle. The arrangement is relatively clear, but the energy and feel of the performance need to be preserved through the mastering process, which requires attentive listening rather than just technical processing.</p>

                            <li>→ <strong className="text-white">Label your files clearly</strong> — correct sample rate, bit depth, clean start and end points.</li>
                            <li>→ <strong className="text-white">Communicate the goal upfront</strong> — streaming release, vinyl, sync licensing. Different formats require different preparation.</li>
