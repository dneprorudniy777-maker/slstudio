    {
        q: "What files do I need to send you?",
        a: "Ideally — separate tracks (stems) for each instrument. But if you only have a rough stereo mix or even a single recording, that works too. Send what you have and we'll figure it out."
    },
    {
        q: "How long does it take?",
        a: "Usually 3–5 business days for a single track. Albums and larger projects are discussed individually."
    },
    {
        q: "How many revisions are included?",
        a: "Up to three rounds of revisions. In practice, one or two is usually enough — we discuss what you want before I start, so I'm already heading in the right direction."
    },
    {
        q: "I have an old studio recording from ten years ago. Can you give it a new sound?",
        a: "Yes — and this is one of the most interesting requests I get. Same song, same vocals, same instruments — but with fresh mixing and modern mastering it sounds completely different. Many artists re-release older material this way."
    },
    {
        q: "Will my track sound good on phone speakers and headphones?",
        a: "I check every track on multiple systems — studio monitors, regular headphones, and a phone speaker. It's only done when it sounds right on all of them."
    },
    {
        q: "What if I don't like the result?",
        a: "This rarely happens because we discuss the direction before I start. But if something isn't right — revisions are included, and I keep working until it is."
    },
    {
        q: "Do you work with low-quality recordings?",
        a: "Yes. A poor recording quality is not a death sentence. I've worked with recordings from garages, rehearsal rooms, and phones. What matters is that the performance is alive — the sound I can fix."
