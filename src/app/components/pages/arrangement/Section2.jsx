        q: "I only have an idea recorded on my phone. Is that enough?",
        a: "More than enough. A voice message, a hummed melody, a guitar riff recorded at 2am — all of it is a starting point. Some of the best tracks started exactly like that."
    },
    {
        q: "Do you use live instruments or samples?",
        a: "Both — it depends on the project. Guitars and some parts I record live myself. Where orchestral, brass, or exotic instruments are needed, I use professional sampled libraries and modern technology. Either way, the result sounds organic."
    },
    {
        q: "My band recorded an idea at rehearsal. Can you turn it into a proper track?",
        a: "That's exactly what I'm here for. A rehearsal recording has a live energy that's very hard to recreate in a studio later. I take that energy and wrap it in professional sound."
    },
    {
        q: "I want a simple guitar recording to sound like a full orchestra. Is that possible?",
        a: "Absolutely. That's called arrangement — and it's one of the most exciting parts of my work. You bring the melody or chords, we discuss the mood and scale you want, and I build a complete musical picture around it."
    },
    {
        q: "Can I choose which instruments go into the track?",
        a: "Of course. It's your music. We discuss everything before I start — genre, instruments, mood, references. I bring ideas but the final decision is always yours."
    },
    {
        q: "What if I don't like the direction you take?",
        a: "That's exactly why I send a demo version first for your approval. You hear the direction before we go any further. No surprises at the end."
    },
    {
        q: "How much does it cost and how does payment work?",
        a: "Every project is individual — it depends on the scope of work. Write to me, describe what you have and what you want, and I'll give you a specific price. First consultation is always free."
