            The Kitchen Voice Memo
          </span>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-white/70 text-[15px] leading-relaxed relative z-10">
            <p>
              Once someone sent me a voice message: a melody hummed into a phone
              in the kitchen, with a dripping tap in the background. The note
              said, “Here is an idea. I do not know what to do with it.”
            </p>
            <p>I listened five times. Then I picked up my guitar.</p>
            <p>
              Three days later, the same melody had live guitars, bass,
              atmospheric keys and percussion. It was still their idea — only
              now it sounded like the song they had been hearing internally.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is how I see arrangement: translation. You hear something
              inside, and I help it come out as real music without replacing
              your accent with mine.
            </p>
          </div>
          <ProTip>
            Do not clean the life out of a demo before sending it. Timing,
            phrasing and even the imperfect little noises can reveal what the
            finished arrangement needs.

            What I Can Build
          </span>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-white/70 text-[15px] leading-relaxed relative z-10">
            <p>
              I work across blues-rock, funk, indie, pop, metal, jazz and
              electronic music. My background is rooted in live instruments and
              groove, but the production method changes with the song.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes the answer is one carefully recorded guitar part.
              Sometimes it is a full arrangement with drums, bass, keys,
              textures and orchestral layers. Bigger is not automatically
              better; the track gets what it actually needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              You hear the direction early and stay involved. It is a
              conversation, not a mysterious package that appears at the end
              with twelve unnecessary tambourines.
            </p>
          </div>
          <ProTip>
            Send two or three reference tracks. One can show the energy, another
            the instrumentation, and the third the space or mood you want.
