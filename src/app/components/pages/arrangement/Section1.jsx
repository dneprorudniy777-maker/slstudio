                        <p>Once someone sent me a voice message. Literally — they hummed a melody into their phone somewhere in the kitchen, you could hear a dripping tap in the background. And wrote: "here's an idea, I don't know what to do with it."</p>
                        <p>I listened five times. Then I picked up my guitar.</p>
                        <p>Three days later they received a complete track — with live guitars, bass, atmospheric keys and percussion. The same melody they hummed in the kitchen, but now it sounded like a song. They wrote back saying they didn't recognize it — in the best way possible.</p>
                        <p>Arrangement for me is translation. You hear something inside, and I help that something come out as real music. I don't impose my taste — I listen to what you want to say and find the instruments that say it best.</p>
                    </div>
                    <ProTip>Don't worry about the quality of what you send. A voice memo with a tap in the background is a perfectly valid starting point — the performance and the idea are what matter. Everything else is my job.</ProTip>

                        <p>I work across all genres — blues-rock, funk, indie, pop, metal, jazz, electronic. My personal background gives me a deep understanding of live instruments and groove, but I bring the same attention to every style.</p>
                        <p>You send what you have — a sketch, a riff, MIDI, a voice recording. We talk about what the result should sound like. I build the arrangement, send you a demo, you hear the direction and tell me what to change. It's always a conversation, never a one-way delivery.</p>
                        <p>Whether you want to add one instrument or create a full orchestral sound — I work with your vision and bring it to life.</p>

                    <ProTip>References are gold. Find two or three songs that have the feel, the instrumentation, or the energy you're going for — and share them. It gets us to the right direction faster than any description.</ProTip>
